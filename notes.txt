Assignment 6: Shaders

VIP: Thomas Rigger

I made my own shaders for the 10-point creative part with uTime. There are four new files for this:
vy_bunny.json (I made a new json file to set the bunny with a new matcap "candy.png")
vy.vs (vertex shader to continuously spin the bunny around an axis)
vy.fs (fragment shader to continuously change the color of the bunny as it spins)
candy.png (in matcaps folder, I googled up matcaps and found this cute one)

In build folder, I ran my rabbit with: ./pipeline ../examples/vy_bunny.json

I hope you like it :)
