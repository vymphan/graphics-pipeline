Assignment 6: Shaders

VIP: Thomas Rigger

I made my own shaders for the 10-point creative part. There are four new files for this:
vy_bunny.json (I made a new json file to set the bunny with a new matcap "candy.png")
vy.vs (vertex shader to continuously spin the bunny around the y axis)
vy.fs (fragment shader to continuously change the color of the bunny as it spins)
candy.png (in matcaps folder, I googled up matcaps and found this cute matcap)
